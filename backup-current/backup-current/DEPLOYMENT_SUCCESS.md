# ðŸŽ‰ FRND Site Rotation System - Deployment Successful!

## Your Stable URL
**https://vimala-panel.netlify.app**

This is the permanent URL you'll share with users. It will never change!

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Set Environment Variables
Go to your Netlify dashboard and set these environment variables:

1. Visit: https://app.netlify.com/projects/vimala-panel/settings/env
2. Add these variables:

```
NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN = your_netlify_api_token
GITHUB_REPO = hardikdesai6774-art/hardik_download
GITHUB_BRANCH = main
URL = https://vimala-panel.netlify.app
```

### 2. Get Your Netlify API Token
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens
2. Click "New access token"
3. Give it a name like "FRND Rotation System"
4. Copy the token and use it as `NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### 3. Test the System

#### Check Status:
```bash
curl https://vimala-panel.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/rotation-status
```

#### Trigger First Rotation:
```bash
curl -X POST https://vimala-panel.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/manual-rotation
```

#### Test Redirect:
```bash
curl -I https://vimala-panel.netlify.app/
```

### 4. Admin Dashboard
Visit: **https://vimala-panel.netlify.app/admin.html**

This provides a web interface to:
- Monitor rotation status
- Trigger manual rotations
- View system logs
- Check next rotation time

### 5. How It Works

1. **Users visit**: https://vimala-panel.netlify.app
2. **Edge function** reads current site URL from Netlify Blobs
3. **302 redirect** sends users to the current rotating site
4. **Every 4 hours** (00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC):
   - Creates a new site from your GitHub repo
   - Updates the redirect target
   - Deletes the old site
